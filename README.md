### Hi there 👋


## About Me

Calm, thoughtful and curious developer, currently at Jay & Jay(Sambot). Been building apps since 2010 in small and big teams for PagesJaunes, SeLoger, Lacoste, Louboutin, KLM, Boomerang and help Mojo with CI/CD.

Outside of regular app development I've contribute to many open source tools that I use and created a lot of tools to improve my team workflow.

I've done a few talks about iOS topics at conferences & meetups. https://speakerdeck.com/mackoj

- ⚙️ Improve process with automation and tooling
- 💡 Being a driver of innovation
- 👥 Help establish best practices
