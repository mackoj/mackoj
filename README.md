### Hi there 👋


## About Me
I am a calm, thoughtful and curious developer, currently building things at Sambot.

In the past I used to lead iOS at PagesJaunes, worked on apps like SeLoger, Lacoste, Louboutin, KLM, Boomerang and help Mojo with delivery efficiency.

Outside of regular app development I've contribute to many open source tools that I use and created a lot of tools to improve my team workflow.

I've done a few talks about iOS topics at conferences & meetups. https://speakerdeck.com/mackoj

## My expertise

I focus on maintainable architecture, improving developer experience and efficiency by:
- 🤔 Designing flexible architecture that can be easily maintained and scaled
- 🛠️ Design, implement and document flexible & pragmatic solutions for the most complex parts
- 🗣 Communicate in clear and simple term with other teams (design, marketing, product, back-end)
- 🧑‍💻 Train new developers
- ⚙️ Improve process with automation and tooling
- 💡 Being a driver of innovation
- 👥 Help establish best practices
